# Build client templates and upload them to cloud storage.

# This script must be run inside travis, as it relies on some travis specific
# environment variables. Ideally it should run in the travis deploy stage rather
# than the script phase (which will run for every pull request), but here is a
# litany of reasons why it doesn't.
#
# There is already a travis gcs deployer but it isn't usable:
# https://github.com/travis-ci/dpl/issues/476
#
# When using the experimental script deployer there were differences between the
# virtual env in the deploy and install stages that caused the client build to
# fail (previously installed grr-* packages would somehow be missing from the
# virtualenv). I'm still attempting to make a minimal reproducible case for a
# good bug report there.
#
# and it's also annoying to debug:
# https://github.com/travis-ci/dpl/issues/477
#
# We could use after_success but it doesn't exit on error:
# https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/758
